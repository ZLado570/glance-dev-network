"""`gdn mcp` — an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the GDN toolkit.

Exposes the SDK to AI assistants as callable tools: scaffold an app, render a
page (the assistant *sees* the panel as an image and can iterate on it),
validate, and look up fonts/colors/text widths. Run it with `gdn mcp`, or let
a client launch it via the `.mcp.json` at the repo root — cloning the repo and
opening Claude Code inside it is all the setup there is.

The protocol is JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, newline-delimited. The handful of
methods a tools/resources/prompts server needs (initialize, the initialized
notification, ping, and the list/call pairs) is small enough to speak directly
instead of adding an SDK dependency — `pip install -e .` stays as light as it is
today, and the server works offline like the rest of gdn. stdout carries
protocol frames ONLY; anything human-readable goes to stderr.

Beyond the tools, the server hands the assistant the things it cannot guess:
`instructions` on the initialize result carries the rules that fail silently
(uppercase fonts, http.get returning a dict), and the resources expose the full
authoring reference plus a working app to copy from. In Claude Code the repo is
on disk and the model can just read it; in Claude Desktop and other clients this
is the only way it learns the API.

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
These tools build apps for Glance LED panels. Before writing app.star, read the \
`glance://reference/authoring` resource — it has the panel model, the full \
drawing API, and the manifest schema — and `glance://reference/design` for how \
good apps look (layout grammar, font roles, color semantics, the four screens). \
`glance://template/app.star` is a working app to copy from.

Design WITH the user, not for them. Before writing any code, ask how they want \
the app to look: request a layout — a drawing, a sketch, or a zone-by-zone \
description (what's the hero, what pixel art, what colors, which widths). Then \
mock up THEIR layout, render it, and iterate until they approve the look — only \
then wire up the data. The design guidelines are defaults the user may override \
case by case; the goal is apps that look great and materially different from \
every other app, never the same AI template filled in twice.

The rules that bite hardest, because nothing errors when you break them:
- Panels are 32px tall. Keep text short and high-contrast.
- Fonts are UPPERCASE ONLY — call .upper() on text, or nothing draws.
- Frames are still images. Never animate or scroll; the panel re-renders on the \
manifest's refresh timer.
- http.get returns a DICT read with subscripts: resp["status_code"], \
resp["json"]. The dotted form errors. Check status_code == 200 first.
- API-key inputs must use app_input_type: api-key, and the input name must not \
contain _ or - (use "apikey").

Render and LOOK at the image rather than assuming — clipped text and unreadable \
colors only show up visually.
